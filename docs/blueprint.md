## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light green (#90EE90) to represent health and growth, fitting with the pharmacy theme. Chosen in HSL as hue 120, saturation 47%, lightness 75%.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E0F7FA) to create a clean and calming feel. This color sits in the same range of green as the primary, giving cohesion, but its saturation of 19% keeps it calm while its brightness of 96% keeps it light.  
- Accent color: A slightly darker, but analogous, shade of light green (#A9DFBF) for highlighting calls to action and key information. Chosen in HSL as hue 143, saturation 35%, lightness 74%.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for English text to provide a modern and readable appearance.
- Additional body font: 'Hind Siliguri' for Bangla text. This provides a locally-relevant and readable appearance in Bangla.
- Use a set of clear and intuitive icons that convey each product's core capabilities and are related to pharmacy management, ensuring visual appeal and readability.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enrich the user experience and maintain interest in different sections of the page.
